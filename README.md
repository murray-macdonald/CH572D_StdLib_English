# CH572 Standard Library - English Translation

This repository contains translated versions of the CH572 Standard Peripheral Drivers and library files with Chinese comments converted to English for better readability and maintainability.

## Purpose

The CH572 microcontroller documentation and library files originally contain Chinese comments. This repository aims to:
1. Provide English translations of all comments in the standard library files
2. Maintain a clean, version-controlled collection of these translated files
3. Serve as a drop-in replacement for the original Chinese-commented library files

## Directory Structure

- `StdPeriphDriver/` - Contains standard peripheral driver source files
  - `inc/` - Header files for standard peripheral drivers
- Additional directories will be added as translation progresses

## Usage

Once files are translated, they can be:
1. Used directly in your projects
2. Copied to your MounRiver Studio template directory to be used as the default for new projects

## Original Source

These files are based on the original CH572 library code provided by WCH (Nanjing Qinheng Microelectronics Co., Ltd.).  

## Testing

These files are untested since automatic translation via Windsurf/Claude 3.7 Sonnet
